Rails Authentication Boilerplate
================================

A boilerplate for Rails applications based on Michael Hartl's book with Zurb's Foundation.

## Why?

Most apps done with Rails (as far as I'm concerned) are done for the need of a back-end with authentication / authorization implemented.

Michael Hartl's system is quite extensive and a good basis for development, but it takes some time to implement it, so here is the authentication mechanism already implemented.

On top of that it has Foundation instead of Bootstrap.

## Next

At the moment this code is just part of Michael Hartl's book code, in the future it will need, at least, to implement all the test suites and be a generator.

After that I would like to have this generator allowing for two types of sites: one offering the possibility of users creating accounts (for when that is required) and another one for when only admins will be able to create new accounts (for example for internal websites).

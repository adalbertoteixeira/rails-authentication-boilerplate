Rails Authentication Boilerplate
================================

A boilerplate for Rails applications based on Michael Hartl's book with Zurb's Foundation.

## Why?

Most apps done with Rails (as far as I'm concerned) are done for the need of a back-end with authentication / authorization implemented.

Michael Hartl's system is quite extensive and a good basis for development, but it takes some time to implement it, so here is the authentication mechanism already implemented.

On top of that it has Foundation instead of Bootstrap.

## Next

At the moment this code is just part of Michael Hartl's book code, in the future it will need, at least, to implement all the test suites.
